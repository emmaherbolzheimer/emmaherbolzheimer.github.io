Big projects are like mountains, and I decieded to climb one the day I accepted my offer to the Learn.co program. I've taken on huge undertakings before and I know these experiences are not easy. That's what I love about climbing, though. I know that it's the hard parts and how we overcome them that define us. That's a sentiment I've carried through these first couple of weeks in the Online Web Development Program. 

There certainly are days when the trails feel easier than others, and as I advance I'm having more of those days than others. When I've found my self stuck, though, I've reached out to the Learn community. I've recieved help from several very knowledgable, kind guides. Without their help, I wouldn't have been able to hurdle the particularly puzzling labs or wrapped my head around the new concepts. 

I see myself growing, though. I catch myself thinking about code all the time, psuedocoding programs in my head and thinking about ways that programming could make certain tasks easier. It's in those moments that I acknowledge how the hard days made that happen. It's on those days that I grow the most, its the hard days that motivate me to keep moving. 

I'm still at the bottom of this mountain but I can see the peak. I don't know what the journey will look like on the way up, however I know there's a whole virtual community of other Learn students and teachers out there on that same path. So thank you to everyone who has helped me and I hope that one day, with a little more experience and knowledge, I'll be able to pay it forward. 

Until then, keep treking.
